title: Learning to Map in OpenStreetMap
---

<p><strong>Narrator</strong>: “In this video tutorial, we’ll show you how to map in OpenStreetMap. Before we begin, however, you will need to create an OpenStreetMap account if you do not already have one.  Please take care when creating the account that you check the box stating that your edits will be available in the public domain and that you will need to accept an alternate terms of service if you reside in France or Italy.”</p>
<p>“Once you’ve set up your OpenStreetMap account, the fun can really begin. After you’ve clicked on start mapping from your OpenStreetMap account confirmation you see a dialog box that says ‘welcome to the iD OpenStreetMap editor.’ Click on the button that says start walkthrough. From there a new map will open up along with several helpful dialog boxes explaining exactly what you are looking at in the editor and how to interact with it. Follow along with the instructio	ns on the screen. They will show how to map three main things: points (used to mark names of places), lines (used to mark roads, tracks, and paths), and areas (used to mark outlines of buildings, fields, and or any other large area).”
</p>
<p>“If you already had an OpenStreetMap account and were already logged in, you just need to click on the drop down arrow next to the word edit in the top left corner of OpenStreetMap. The drop down arrow will give you a few options. Select ‘Edit with iD (in browser editor).”
</p>
<p>“Before we begin showing you how to map, we’d like to remind you to save. By clicking save after making an edit to OpenStreetMap, your changes go live to the entire world.”
</p>
<p>“First, mapping a point. To map a point in the OpenStreetMap iD editor, simply click on the point button in the top left of the map. It will turn blue to let you know that it’s been selected. Then simply click on a position in the map where there is a building or area that you’d like to define. A NODE will appear. Also, a dialog box with a series of descriptive inputs will appear to the left of the map. If you know the name of the building or area, or additional details, you can enter them here. Once you’ve finished adding details connected to the node, you can close the dialog box by clicking on the x at the top right of it. If you need to edit the node again, simply click on it again and the dialog box will open. If you need to delete a node that is incorrect or created by mistake, click on node. A trash can icon will appear next to it. Click on the trash can and the node will be removed.” 
</p>
<p>“If you ever need to step back a few edits, click on the back arrow icon at the top of the editor. You can also step forward a few edits with the forward arrow icon.” </p>
<p>“Mapping a line. Just as you clicked on the point button before, now click on the line button at the top of the iD OpenStreetMap editor. It will also turn blue to let you know that it’s been selected. Now click on a position on the map. A dot will appear connected to a line. Click on another other point on the map and another dot will appear and the line will connect those two point. You can either continue to draw more points to establish the line or click the ESC button to finish drawing the line. The line will glow red to let you know that it has been created. A dialog box will open up to the left of the map editor. He you can specify whether the line is a road, path, river, or any other number of options. You can be very specific or general depending on what you can determine from the satellite picture. To modify a line that has already been created, simply click on it. The dialog box will open next to the editor along with the trashcan icon next to the line.” 
</p>
<p>“Mapping an area. An area can either be a park, a building, a lake, a forest, or any other number of things. It’s up to you. Just as with points and lines, click on the area button at the top of the editor. It will turn blue to let you know that you’ve selected it. Once you’ve done that, select the edges of the building or space you want to define. Just click on the corners and the editor will fill in the space in between. Once you’ve fully outlined what you want, press the ESC button. The area will turn red to let you know that it’s been created. A dialog box will appear next to the map editor and allow you to classify the area you’ve just defined. There are numerous options and you can be as specific or general as you need to, depending on what information you know.”</p>
<p>“Always remember to hit save at the top of the editor. This allows for your map edits to be visible by other OpenStreetMap users.” 
</p>
<p>“That’s it. That’s all it takes to start mapping in OpenStreetMap. Once you hit save your edits are live and part of the OpenStreetMap data which is immediately available to anyone in the world. We would kindly ask that you pause this video and take some time to practice what you’ve just learned. Once you feel confident in your ability to map, continue to the next video for information on how to map areas in need and make a difference.”
