<p><strong>Narrator</strong>: “In this video tutorial, we’ll show you how to select a task from the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap team’s tasking manager so you can start mapping to make a difference. </p>
<p>Now that you know how to map, it’s time to put those skills to work. As you’ve seen, mapping is easy and in just a few short moments, you can make edits that can help others around the world.</p>
<p>From MapGive’s start mapping page, scroll down below this video and click on “selecting a task.” You will be taken to the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap team’s tasking manager. You simply need to identify roads, paths, buildings, and areas in the same way you did when you were learning to map. You will most likely not be able to add names to areas and roads but that is okay. Others with special knowledge of the area will add that information later.</p>
<p>At the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap tasking manager landing page, click on log in with your OpenStreetMap account. If you are still logged in to OpenStreetMap, you will not need to enter your login info. A new page will open asking if the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap tasking manager can connect to your OpenStreetMap account. Click the accept button. You will be taken to a new page will a list of available jobs. These are what the areas that you will be mapping. You can see the titles, a description, who created them, when they were last updated, and a percentage bar to show how complete the map is at this moment. </p>
<p><em>Select a job</em>. Once you’ve selected a job, a new page will open with a map and some information. The information about the job includes a description of what the requester would like you to focus on, workflow, the tasks, which users have worked on this job, and some stats about the job. 
</p>
<p>Let’s use the interactive map and zoom in on the highlighted tiles. The job has been broken up into small tile areas of the map to allow you to do a little bit of mapping rather than trying to map the entire area. This also lets other simultaneously map other tiles, or areas. By doing this in small pieces, you can all work faster.</p>
<p>Gray tiles represent all of the tasks available in this job. Red tiles are areas that have been marked as done. Green tiles are areas that were marked as done but have now been validated. Gray tiles with yellow outlines are areas that are currently being worked on. Click on a gray tile to select it. This will allow you to start mapping. By selecting a tile you are “checking it out.” No one else will be able to edit this tile while you are working on it. Once you have completed working on the tile you will need to “check it back in” so others can validate or build on your work. We’ll explain how to check areas back in shortly.
</p>
<p>Once you select a gray tile, the task tab will open up next to the map. The task tab has three sections: 1, open the area in your favorite editing tool 2, trace the elements and 3, add a comment and mark the task as done. You will also see to the left of the map, a notice that says this imagery is shared by the NextView license will appear. Click on the text to view and accept the license. 
</p>
<p>There is one additional step. You’ll need to copy the imagery URL from the tasking manager into the iD OpenStreetMap editor. To do this, simply copy the URL. We’ll show you where to paste the URL in a second. 
</p>
<p>Select iD from the editing tool options. This is the same editor you used to learn how to map in OpenStreetMap. This will open a new tab with OpenStreetMap and the iD editor. 
</p>
<p>Click on the layers icon on the right side of the screen in the OpenStreetMap editor. Click on “custom” and paste in the imagery URL. This will place the high resolution satellite imagery into the editor for you to use when making your edits. 
</p>
<p>You’ll know that the satellite imagery has loaded when you see the “Digital Globe” branding on the newly place imagery. It may take a while for the satellite imagery to load depending on your internet connection. 
</p>
<p>Now, simply make edits to the map - adding roads, paths, buildings, and areas - just like you did when you learned to map earlier. 
</p>
<p>For example, just as you did in the practice, identify roads by looking at them and tracing them. It’s that easy. 
</p>
<p>Please note that you will not see the border of the tile you've selected in the map editor. That's okay. Try and stay within the area in which the map loads when you open the editor. BUT if you map outside of that area as well, that's okay too. 
</p>
<p>Some map areas will have a lot to map. Some will be mostly empty. Do as much as you can or want and then save your edits. Once you have made edits and saved them, go back to the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap tasking manager tab. On the left side of the screen, at the bottom, you can mark the tile as done if you feel like you have made all of the map edits possible in that area. If you did some edits but there were still more to do, you can click on “unlock it” to release the map tile back for others to edit. If you saved your edits in the iD editor, they will still be there others or for you to come back to. 
</p>
<p>If you feel like you need a little more practice before jumping in, go back to the MapGive “start mapping” page and re-watch the “how to map” video. Follow along and practice until you feel confident enough to give mapping a try for real.
</p>
<p>That’s it. You’re now a full-fledged mapper! Thank you for learning how to map and also for mapping to make a difference. For further help, please read the written guides on this site.”
