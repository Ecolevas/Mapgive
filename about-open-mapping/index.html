          <p>OpenStreetMap (OSM) is a non-profit project that is building a free map of the whole world. There are a lot of free maps on the Internet, but they are only free to view, not to use the data for an application, such as your own web page. By contrast, OpenStreetMap makes it possible to use freely the map and all its data. The data is released under a free license (Open Data Commons Open Database License 1.0).</p>
<p>Thousands of members are teamed to create an accurate, detailed and up-to-date map that is as good or better than commercial products.</p>

          <p>The Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team [H.O.T.] began when an earthquake hit Haiti in 2010 to support the rescue squads on the ground.  The Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT) is incorporated as a U.S. based 501c(3) non-profit organization. Its mission is to apply the principles of open source and open data sharing towards humanitarian response and economic development.</p>
