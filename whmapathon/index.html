      <h3>Mapathon Power Utility Areas</h3>
      <p>The Department of Energy's Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability is creating a national geospatial database of power company service areas and pointers to public outage information (eg, Twitter, web sites, and via 800 numbers). Data about power company service areas and their announcements about outages are critical for the effective coordination of resources after disasters, and also for building community and neighborhood resilience.</p>
      <p>Participants will research public outage information state by state, and populate a lookup table so that disaster-impacted residents, tourists, first responders and relief volunteers can easily get to the information they need on scope and estimated restore times for power outages. This project will benefit from participation of private and public sector folks who need this data for their work, and of third party app developers such as Red Cross and The Weather Channel who will incorporate this data into the information services they offer their users.</p>

      <h3>Every Kid in a Park</h3>
      <p>In the lead up to the 100th birthday of the National Park Service in 2016, the President’s Every Kid in a Park initiative is a call to action to get all children to visit and enjoy America’s unparalleled outdoors.</p>
      <p>This dataset documents sites where educational activities related to the Every Kid in a Park initiative are available, as collected by the various agencies represented under FICOR.   Through this exercise we’re going to improve the location and attributes for this information to provide better planning resources and contextual information for the “find your park” aspect of the initiative.</p>

      <h3>Humanitarian Mapping</h3>
      <p>MapGive, a public diplomacy program, is a flagship initiative of the State Department’s Open Government Plan. Through shared imagery services, analysis, promotion, event organizing, and technical expertise in OSM for the Department’s domestic bureaus and diplomatic posts, other U.S. Government agencies, and other governments through international fora, MapGive supports the use of OpenStreetMap in humanitarian response and development.</p>
      <p>At the White House Mapathon, we have identified three sub-projects of shared humanitarian interest with MapGive partners (USAID, Peace Corps, World Bank GFDRR, Missing Maps), and mapping coordinated through the OSM Tasking Manager. First will focus on Nepal and the response to the earthquake, of particular interest to USAID OFDA and GFDRR; second on Peace Corps public health initiatives in Botswana; and third in the Philippines, on disaster preparedness and development, a focus of the World Bank.</p>
