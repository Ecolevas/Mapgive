This site was built using Jekyll, a static site generator (Intro to Jekyll video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7NBEFmA7yA)

This is an existing Grunt project (http://gruntjs.com/getting-started). 
Assuming that the Grunt CLI has been installed and that the project has already been configured with a package.json and a Gruntfile, it's very easy to start working with Grunt:

1.Change to the project's root directory.
2.Install project dependencies with npm install.
3.Run Grunt with grunt.

-The Grunt file does many optimization functions and builds the Jekyll site
