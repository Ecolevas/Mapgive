                  <p>Goal: Learn to Map in OSM. Whether you are brand new to online mapping or familiar with the process, this guide will explain OSM tools and workflow in context.  The goal is to prepare you to answer humanitarian calls for volunteer mappers. Estimated time:  Plan on 1-3 hours.</p>
                  <p>The first time you select the button, <strong>Start Mapping</strong>, a pop up bar appears at the top of the screen. It asks if wish to allow OpenStreetMap to know your current location.</p>
                  <p><strong>Tip</strong>: If the pop up disappears before you have a chance to complete the step, click the browser back button and select <strong>Start Mapping again</strong>.</p>
                  <p>Select <strong>Deny</strong> or <strong>Allow</strong> on the pop up bar. These instructions assume you have selected <strong>Allow</strong>. <strong>Tip</strong>: TBD what to do if you select Deny</p>
                  <p>A map of your current location will open up along with a dialog box that says, <strong>Welcome to the iD OpenStreetMap editor</strong>.</p>
                  <p>Select <strong>Start the Walkthrough</strong>. A new map opens; notice the explanatory dialog boxes that explain what you are looking at. There are also a number of tabs, including three we will focus on. These are noted in bold:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Navigation</li>
                    <li><strong>Points</strong> (used to mark names of places)</li>
                    <li><strong>Lines</strong> (used to mark roads, tracks, and paths)</li>
                    <li><strong>Areas</strong> (used to mark outlines of buildings, fields, and or any other large area)</li>
                    <li>Start Editing</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p><strong>TIP</strong>: Even though you will not need to mark any points, as you won&#39;t know the names, it is good to understand how to mark them. </p>
                  <p>Assuming you are logged into your OpenStreetMap account, select the dropdown arrow next to the word <strong>Edit</strong> in the top left corner of the screen. Select the option <strong>Edit with iD</strong> (in browser editor). </p>
                  <p><strong>Map a Point</strong><br />To map a point in the OpenStreetMap iD editor:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Select the <strong>Point</strong> button in the top left of the map. It will turn blue to let you know that it&#39;s been selected. Then click a position in the map where there is a building or area that you&#39;d like to define.</li>
                    <li>A <strong>Node</strong> icon appears. (<a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Node" target="_blank">Wikipedia defines a node</a> as: &ldquo;One of the core elements in the OpenStreetMap data model. It consists of a single point in space defined by its latitude, longitude and node id.&rdquo;) </li>
                    <li>The <strong>Set feature type /Set feature type</strong> dialog box also appears to the left of the map with a series of descriptive inputs. If you know the name of the building or area, or additional details, enter them here.</li>
                    <li>Once you&#39;ve finished adding details connected to the node, close the dialog box by clicking on the <strong>X</strong> to the right of <strong>Edit Feature</strong> at the top.</li>
                    <li>To edit the node again, click on it again and the dialog box will reopen.</li>
                    <li>To delete a node that is incorrect, or created by mistake, click on node. A trashcan icon appears next to it. Click on the trashcan to remove the node.</li>
                    <li>If you ever need to step back a few edits, click the undo (reverse arrow) icon at the top of the editor. You can allow step forward a few edits with the redo (forward arrow) icon.</li>
                    <li>Always remember to hit save at the top of the editor. This allows for your map edits to be visible by other OpenStreetMap users.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p><strong>Map a Line</strong><br />To map a line in the OpenStreetMap iD editor:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Click the <strong>Line</strong> button at the top of the iD OpenStreetMap editor. It turns blue to indicate it is selected.</li>
                    <li>Click on a position on the map. A dot appears connected to a line.</li>
                    <li>Click on another other point on the map; another dot appears and the line will connect those two points.</li>
                    <li>Draw more points to establish the line or, click the <strong>Esc</strong> escape button on your keyboard to finish drawing the line.</li>
                    <li>The line then glows red to let you know that it has been created and a dialog box opens up to the left of the map editor. </li>
                    <li>Specify whether the line is a road, path, river or other options.</li>
                    <li>You may be specific or general depending on the satellite picture.</li>
                    <li>To modify a line that has already been created, click on it. The dialog box reopens next to the editor along with the trashcan icon next to the line.</li>
                    <li>Always remember to hit save at the top of the editor. This allows for your map edits to be visible by other OpenStreetMap users. </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p><strong>Map an Area</strong><br />An area can be a park, a building, a lake, a forest or other types of enclosed filled land. To map an area in the OpenStreetMap iD editor:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Click on the area button at the top of the editor. It turns blue to let you know that you&#39;ve selected it. </li>
                    <li>Select the edges of the building or land you want to define. Just click on the corners and the editor will fill in the space between.</li>
                    <li>Once you&#39;ve fully outlined what you want, press the <strong>Esc</strong> escape button on your keyboard. The area will turn red to let you know that it&#39;s been created. </li>
                    <li>A dialog box will appear next to the map editor and allow you to classify the area you&#39;ve just defined. There are numerous options and you may be as general or specific as possible.</li>
                    <li>Always remember to hit save at the top of the editor. This allows for your map edits to be visible by other OpenStreetMap users. </li>
                    <li>Once you hit save your edits are live and part of the OpenStreetMap data and immediately available to anyone in the world. </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p><strong>Learn to Trace Satellite Image Objects</strong><br />
                    Before selecting one of the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap team&#39;s highlighted tasks to work on, you&#39;ll need the ability to interpret what you will see in satellite imagery. You may be familiar with the type of structures and roads populate your own area but types and shapes of structures and paths vary around the world. That&#39;s why we created this tracing guide and image file as a handy resource.
                  </p>
                  <p>Take some time to practice using these tools and once you gain confidence in your ability to map, navigate to the Get Started tab to choose one of the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap team&#39;s highlighted tasks.</p>
                  <p>Congratulations on completing step 2 &mdash; Learn to Map!</p>
